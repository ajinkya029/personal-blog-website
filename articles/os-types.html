                            processes, and memory. Thus operating system acts
                            as the manager of all the resources, i.e. resource manager. Thus, the operating system
                            becomes an interface between user
                            and machine.</p>

                        <p><strong>Types of Operating Systems:</strong> Some widely used operating systems are as
                            follows</p>
                        <h3>1. Batch Operating System</h3>
                        <p>
                            This type of operating system does not interact with the computer directly.
                            There is an operator which takes similar jobs having the same requirement and group them
                            into batches.
                            It is the responsibility of the operator to sort jobs with similar needs.
                        </p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../images/operating-system/batch-os.png" alt="" class="img-size">

                        </figure>

                        <h3>2. Time-Sharing Operating Systems </h3>
                        <p>
                            Each task is given some time to execute so that all the tasks work smoothly.
                            Each user gets the time of CPU as they use a single system.
                            These systems are also known as Multitasking Systems.
                            The task can be from a single user or different users also.
                            The time that each task gets to execute is called quantum.
                            After this time interval is over OS switches over to the next task.
                        </p>

                        </figure>

                        <h3>3. Distributed Operating System</h3>
                        <p>
                            These types of the operating system is a recent advancement in the world of computer
                            technology and are
                            being widely accepted all over the world and, that too, with a great pace.
                            Various autonomous interconnected computers communicate with each other using a shared
                            communication
                            network.
                            Independent systems possess their own memory unit and CPU.
                            These are referred to as loosely coupled systems or distributed systems.
                            These system&apos;s processors differ in size and function.
                            The major benefit of working with these types of the operating system is that it is
                            always possible that one
                            user can access the files or software which are not actually present on his system but
                            some other system
                            connected within this network i.e., remote access is enabled within the devices
                            connected in that network.

                        </figure>

                        <h3>4. Network Operating System </h3>
                        <p>
                            These systems run on a server and provide the capability to manage data, users, groups,
                            security,
                            applications, and other networking functions.
                            These types of operating systems allow shared access of files, printers, security,
                            applications, and other
                            networking functions over a small private network.
                            One more important aspect of Network Operating Systems is that all the users are well
                            aware of the
                            underlying configuration, of all other users within the network, their individual
                            connections, etc. and
                            that&apos;s why these computers are popularly known as tightly coupled systems.
                        </p>

                        <h3>5. Real-Time Operating System</h3>
                        <p>
                            These types of OSs serve real-time systems.
                            The time interval required to process and respond to inputs is very small.
                            This time interval is called response time.
                            Real-time systems are used when there are time requirements that are very strict like
                            missile systems, air
                            traffic control systems, robots, etc.
                        </p>
