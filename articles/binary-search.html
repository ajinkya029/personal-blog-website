                                or array</a>. We will
                            cover the binary search
                            algorithm in complete detail and try to implement it with C++.</p>
                        <p>In mathematics and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" class="ref"
                                target="_blank">computer science</a>, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined,
                            computer-implementable
                            instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. One such
                            algorithm that we will cover
                            in this article is the binary search algorithm.</p>
                        <p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" class="ref"
                                target="_blank">computer science</a>,
                            binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search,
                            or binary chop, is a search
                            algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search
                            compares the target value to
                            the middle element of the array.</p>
                        <p>If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the search
                            continues on the remaining
                            half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value and repeating this
                            until the target value is found.
                            If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.</p>
                        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                        <p>Given a sorted array arr[] of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in
                            arr[] and return the
                            index of x in the array.</p>

                        <h3>Examples</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Input :</strong> arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 50, 60, 80, 110, 130, 140, 170}, x = 110<br>
                            <strong>Output :</strong> 6<br>
                            <strong>Explanation :</strong> Element x is present at index 6. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Input :</strong> arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 110, 120, 130, 170}, x = 175<br>
                            <strong>Output :</strong> -1<br>
                            <strong>Explanation :</strong> Element x is not present in arr[].<br>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Step-wise Intuition Of The Binary Search Algorithm</h3>
                        <p>Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It
                            works by repeatedly dividing
                            in half the portion of the list that could contain the item until you have narrowed down the
                            possible locations to just
                            one. Let us understand the step-wise implementation of this algorithm.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Sort the list or array you have in an ascending order.
                            </li>
                            <li>The starting element is called &apos;L&apos;and the final element is called
                                &apos;R&apos;. Using these
                                values we try to narrow down the
                                middle element by using the formula (L+R)/2. This operation basically performs a floor
                                function to achieve the desired
                                middle element. An alternate approach is to use the ceil function, but we will cover
                                this method in the following
                                article today.</li>
                            <li>The next step is to check if the value of the middle element is equivalent to the
                                desired value. If yes, then the search
                                is successful and can be terminated.</li>
                            <li>If the desired value is lesser than the middle element, all the values from the middle
                                element to the &apos;R&apos; value are
                                eliminated. And the repetition of step 2 and 3 takes place.</li>
                            <li>If the desired value is greater than the middle element, all the values from the middle
                                element to the &apos;L&apos; value are
                                eliminated. And the repetition of step 2 and 3 takes place.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Let us consider an example to gain better intuition of the working of the following steps
                            mentioned above. The below
                            diagram is a representation of a sorted array with 17 elements. We are trying to locate the
                            position of item 7. Let&apos;s
                            analyze the step-wise procedure of how this task is performed.</p>
                        <figure>

                            <figcaption>Image from <a
                                    href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Binary_Search_Depiction.svg"
                                    class="ref" target="_blank">Wiki</a>
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>The above diagram contains a list of 17 elements ranging from 0 to 16. The first step is to
                            divide the list by bisecting
                            it into two halves with the above-mentioned formula of (L+R)/2 which would be (16+0)//2 and
                            would return a value of 8.</p>
                        <p>The element at the 8th position is 14, but the desired value is 7. Hence all the elements
                            from the 8th position to the
                            last position can be eliminated. And steps 2 and steps 3 can be repeated again. (0+7)/2
                            would return a position of 3
                            and the value of 6. The desired value is greater than the found value. Hence, we can follow
                            the fifth step and repeat
                            step 2 and step 3 again.</p>
                        <p>Finally, The value of 4 can be found successfully with this procedure of the binary search
                            algorithm. To understand this
                            in a more algorithmic manner, I would highly recommend to check out the following
                            explanation from <a

                        <p>In this section, let us get our hands dirty with some coding.</p>
                        <p>There are many methods of implementing this algorithm, like the iterative or recursive way.
                            In this article, we will
                            focus on a simple method of performing this task.</p>

                        <h3>Space complexity</h3>
                        <p>Binary search requires three pointers to elements, which may be array indices or pointers to
                            memory locations,
                            regardless of the size of the array. <br>Therefore, the space complexity of binary search is
                            <strong>O(1)</strong> in the Word RAM model of computation.

                        <p>In the modern day, the binary search algorithm has a function of its own in almost every

                            can be implemented easily by making use of such functions. C++ STL provides the
                            <strong>binary_search()</strong> function
                            for performing the binary

                        <p>In this article, we discussed the procedural implementation of the binary search algorithm
                            which is one of the basic
                            algorithms in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" class="ref"
                                target="_blank">computer
                                science</a>. It can efficiently find an index of an element in a sorted
                            list by repeatedly halving
                            the search range until the element is found, so its running time is a logarithm of the list
                            size.</p>
