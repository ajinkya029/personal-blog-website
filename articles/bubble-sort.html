                        <p>In this article, I&apos;ll be covering bubble sort algorithm. Most programming languages will
                            come
                            with a built-in sort function
                            but in order to write better code, you need to know what&apos;s going on in the background.
                            If
                            you are preparing for software
                            engineering interviews, it&apos;s very likely that this sorting algorithm may come
                            up
                            during your interviews.</p>

                        <h3>What is a Bubble Sort?</h3>
                        <p>Bubble sort is one of the simplest and intuitive sorting algorithms to understand. Its
                            implementation in code is fairly
                            straightforward as well. One of the great things about Bubble Sort is that learning it
                            teaches you a lot about
                            complexity analysis and will prepare you to understand more difficult and more optimal
                            sorting algorithms.</p>

                        <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
                        <p>Let&apos;s have a look at the array we want to sort:
                        </p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-1.png" alt="">
                        <p>We want to sort this array in ascending order.</p>
                        <p>In Bubble Sort, we iterate through the array multiple times and swap values until they are
                            all in the correct order.
                            More specifically, when we iterate through the array, we check if the current number is
                            greater than the number adjacent
                            to it. If so, we swap the two numbers in-place.</p>
                        <p>Doing these swaps in-place is important to note. <em class="bold">We do not need extra memory
                                to perform
                                Bubble Sort.</em></p>

                        <p>After we traverse through the whole array, we check if any swaps have been done during the
                            iteration. If we have done
                            swaps, we need to iterate through the array again to make sure everything is sorted. If any
                            values are still not
                            ordered, we perform swaps again and we repeat the process of traversing the whole array
                            until it is completely sorted
                            and no more swaps are needed. Visualizing this process makes it even clearer:</p>
                        <p>Let&apos;s start at the beginning of our array. Our current value is 6:
                        </p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-2.png" alt="">
                        <p>Is 6 less than or equal to 3? (i.e. Are they in the correct order?). No, so we need to swap
                            the two values.</p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-3.png" alt="">

                        <p>Our current value is now at position 1. Let&apos;s look at the next value to the right. Is 6
                            less
                            than or equal to 9? Yes. At
                            this point, 6 will remain at this position and we change our current value to 9.</p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-4.png" alt="">
                        <p>9 is greater than 8. Let&apos;s swap them.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-5.png" alt="">
                        <p>9 is greater than 4. Let&apos;s swap.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-6.png" alt="">
                        <p>9 is greater than 6. Let&apos;s swap.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-7.png" alt="">

                        <p>9 is greater than 5. Let&apos;s swap.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-8.png" alt="">
                        <p>9 is greater than 2. Let&apos;s swap.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-9.png" alt="">

                        <p>9 does not have any values to swap with. Its <em class="bold">Bubbled Up</em> to the end of
                            our array.
                            This is the
                            essence of Bubble Sort.
                            Larger values bubble up to the end of the array until the array is sorted.</p>
                        <p>At this point, we have completed one iteration in the array. We ask ourselves, did we do any
                            swaps during the iteration?
                            We did lots. In this case, we need to go back and check our array to see if sorting has been
                            completed. Visually, we see
                            that it hasn&apos;t of course, but the way to know this in our code is to track swaps.</p>
                        <p>Sorted values are colored blue. We do not need to work on these values anymore. Let&apos;s go
                            through the rest of this array.
                            Our next current value is back at the beginning. Current value = 3.</p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-10.png" alt="">
                        <p>3 is less than 6. We won&apos;t do anything with it. We see that 6 is also less than 8. We
                            won&apos;t
                            do anything with that
                            either. Let&apos;s move on to 8.</p>
                        <p>Visually, we see that 8 is greater than all the values to its right until it reaches our
                            sorted 9. 8 will swap with
                            every value just like 9 did until it reaches the position just before 9, completing the
                            iteration.</p>
                        <p>So, did we perform any swaps? Yes. So let&apos;s go for another round.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-11.png" alt="">
                        <p>Like before, 3 is less than 6 so it stays in place and we move on to our next value.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-12.png" alt="">
                        <p>6 swaps with 4. We now compare 6 and 6. Is 6 greater than 6? No. Our current 6 at index 2
                            will remain there and change
                            our current value to the next 6 at index 3.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-13.png" alt="">
                        <p>We can see visually that our current value will bubble up to just before the 8. We check if
                            we have performed swaps, and
                            indeed we have so let&apos;s start again:
                        </p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-14.png" alt="">
                        <p>And another round:
                        </p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-15.png" alt="">
                        <p>And another:
                        </p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-16.png" alt="">
                        <p>Almost there:
                        </p>
                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-17.png" alt="">
                        <p>Last one!

                        <img src="../images/bubble-sort/bubble-sort-working-18.png" alt="">
                        <p>2 cannot be swapped with anything so our swaps are zero for this round. This means we are
                            done!</p>
